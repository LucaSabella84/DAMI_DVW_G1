# Poppy Field – Key Message

## What is the key message being conveyed?

The key message of [Poppy Field](https://www.poppyfield.org) is:

> **War has never stopped. Despite the immense human cost, armed conflict has continued relentlessly throughout the modern era.**

The visualisation was created for the centenary of World War I (1914–2014) — a war often called "the war to end all wars." Yet since then, over **200 conflicts** have taken place. The site confronts the viewer with this sobering reality: the hope embedded in that phrase was never realised.

Each poppy represents a war. The poppy is a deliberate symbol — widely associated with remembrance of the fallen. By rendering over a century of conflict as a field of poppies, the project transforms raw data (start/end dates, death tolls, regions) into a visual act of collective mourning and reflection.

## How does it fit the workshop framework?

From the Data Visualisation Workshop (Raumanns & van den Ham, 2026), a successful visualisation requires:

| Element | In Poppy Field |
|---|---|
| **Powerful message** | War persists; its human toll is staggering and ongoing |
| **Story** | A century of conflict told through the metaphor of a poppy field |
| **Reliable data** | Sourced from The Polynational War Memorial |
| **Compelling form** | Interactive, animated poppies — size = deaths, colour = region, stem = timeline |

The visualisation does not argue or persuade — it memorialises. The creators intentionally present the data without commentary, letting the visual scale of the poppy field speak for itself. This aligns with the workshop's principle that effective visualisations reduce cognitive load while amplifying emotional and intellectual impact.
