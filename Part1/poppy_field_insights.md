# Poppy Field – Insights

## What insights are provided?

The visualisation reveals patterns across four dimensions — duration, fatalities, location, and participants — that would be invisible in a table or list:

- **War is continuous, not exceptional.** Over 200 conflicts occurred in the 100 years following WWI (1918–2018). The sheer density of poppies communicates that war is a persistent condition, not a series of isolated events.
- **Scale of death varies enormously.** The size encoding makes it immediately apparent that a small number of wars (e.g. WWI, WWII) dwarf the rest in human cost. Most conflicts are comparatively small flowers.
- **Geography shapes conflict.** The colour encoding by region allows viewers to spot geographic concentration — certain regions (Africa, Asia) are visually dominant in many time periods, revealing where the burden of modern conflict has been heaviest.
- **War duration is unpredictable.** Stems of varying lengths show that conflicts range from brief engagements to decades-long wars, with no obvious pattern.
- **The "war to end all wars" narrative is visually refuted.** By anchoring the visualisation to 1914–2014, the design makes explicit that WWI did not stop war — the field grows continuously after 1918.

Users can filter by location and death toll range, enabling personal exploration rather than a single prescribed reading.
