# Poppy Field – Datasets Used

## Source

The visualization uses data from **The Polynational War Memorial**, credited as the sole source of all data.

## Coverage

The dataset covers **wars since 1900** and includes:

- Start and end dates of each conflict
- Death tolls per war
- Geographic locations of conflicts
- Participating nations

## Caveats

- The research is described as a "work in progress" and may be incomplete
- Alternative sources are cited in individual conflict notes where used
- The source data has been updated since the visualization was first published in *The Infographic History of the World*
