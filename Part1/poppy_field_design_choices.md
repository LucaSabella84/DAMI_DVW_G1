# Poppy Field – Design Choices

## What design choices are made in the presentation?

### Visual encoding
| Variable | Encoding |
|---|---|
| Each war | One poppy (shape as metaphor) |
| Start date | Position of stem base on timeline |
| End date | Position where poppy blooms |
| Duration | Length of stem |
| Death toll | Size of the poppy head |
| Geographic region | Colour of the poppy |

### Metaphor and symbolism
The poppy is the central design decision. It is not a neutral icon — it carries deep cultural meaning as a symbol of war remembrance (originating from WWI battlefields). Using it as the data mark means every data point arrives pre-loaded with emotional weight, without requiring any explanatory text.

### Interactivity
- **Timeline scrubbing** — users can move through time, watching the field grow
- **Filters by location and death toll** — reduces cognitive load by letting users focus on subsets
- **Click-to-detail** — individual poppies reveal war name, dates, deaths, and participants

### Aesthetic tone
The design is deliberately contemplative rather than analytical. There are no bar charts, no rankings, no "winners." The field metaphor invites the viewer to pause and reflect — consistent with the workshop's storytelling principles (understand context → choose an effective visual → eliminate clutter → focus attention → tell a story).

### What the design deliberately avoids
- No political framing or commentary
- No ranking or hierarchy of "important" wars
- No aggressive use of red or imagery of violence — the poppy softens the subject matter while still conveying scale
