Summary 

This particular visualization provides information about the wars that have occurred since the beginning of the 20th century, describes countries that have been involved in a particular conflict, and shows the duration of conflicts and the number of casualties. The data is visualized in a graph way describing the duration on the Y-axis, which is represented logarithmically in order to demonstrate the high difference in duration (approx. 6 months - 65 years), while on the X-axis the timeline from 1899 until 2014 is mentioned.  The root of the poppy is at the beginning of the war, while the head is at the end of the war. The head design (colors, petals) illustrates on which particular conflicts wars have occurred. Additionally, the size of the head of poppies illustrates the number of war casualties: the higher the number, the bigger the head. By clicking on a certain poppy, it is possible to study a certain conflict in detail. The conflicts can be filtered by a number of casualties and time periods.

Assessing the content, it can be clearly stated that the data visualization shows a good-looking representation of past events, involving appropriate design techniques in order to emphasize the scale of horrible wars. The data itself can provide the most relevant insights of a certain conflict, allowing the visitors to filter out what is necessary for them. Although only the most general information is showcased, it is 100% enough given the context and the mood of the website.

In concluding terms, the application demonstrates the basic information of the conflicts in a well-designed way, which is a good strategy to introduce the users to a certain war. However, the detailed information must be gathered elsewhere, which does not worsen the visualization.
